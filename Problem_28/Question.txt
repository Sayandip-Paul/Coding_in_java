Java- Second Problem Statement
Question:
Create a class Projector with below attributes:
projectorld - int 
projectorName - String
price - int (per unit)
rating - int
availableln - String (Amazon, Flipkart, Tata Cliq)


The above attributes should be private, write getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required.
Create class Solution with main method.
Implement one static method - find MaximumPriceByRating in Solution class.
findMaximumPrice By Rating method:
The method will return the maximum priced Projector object from array of Projector objects whichever has rating greater than the given rating and which is available in Tata Cliq.
If no Projector with the above conditions is present in the array of Projector objects, then the method should return null.
Note: No two Projector will have the same price.
All the searches should be case insensitive.
The above mentioned static method should be called from the main method.
For findMaximum Price By Rating method - The main method should print the projectorld from returned object if the returned value is not null else it should print "No such Projector".
Eg: 1001
where 1001 is the projectorld which has the maximum price.
Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Projector objects referring attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence.
Next, read the value of one int parameter for capturing rating value.
