Create a class Player with below attributes:

playerld - int
playerName - string 
runs - int 
playerType  String
matchType string

The above attributes should be private, getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required 

Create class Solution with main method.

Implement two static methods. findPlayerWithLowestRuns and 
findPlayerByMatchType in Solution class.

find PlayerWithLowRuns method:

This method will take array of Player objects
and a String value as input parameters.

The method will return the least runs of the Player from array of Player objects for the given player type. (String parameter passed).
If no Player with the above condition are present in array of Player objects. then the method should return 0.

findPlayerByMatchType method: This method will take array of Player objects and String value as input parameters and return the array of players object
belonging to the match type passed as input parameter in Descending order of playerld.
 If no Player with the above condition are present in the array of Player null. then the method should return

Note: No two Players will have the same PlayerId and runs 

All the searches should be case insensitive. 

The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.

For findPlayerWithLowestRuns method - The main method should print the returned runs as it is if the returned value 
is greater than 0 or it should print "No such player",

eg. 25
where 25 is the lowest runs of the Player

For findPlayerByMatchType method - The main method should print the playerld from the returned Player array for each 
Player if the returned value is not null. If the returned value is null then it should print "No
Player with given matchType"

Eg:

13
11

where 13 and 11 are the playerld's.

Before calling these static methods in main use Scanner object to read the values of four Player 
objects referring attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence.


Next, read the value of two String parameter for capturing player type and match Type.

Consider below input and output:
